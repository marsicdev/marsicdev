### Hi there and welcome ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Marko** and I'm actively engaged in developing software solutions for the last 10 years using Java, Kotlin, ObjectiveC / Swift and JavaScript programming languages. Although I use a wide variety of libraries and frameworks, my focus and expertise are mobile applcations and for the last four years mostly React and React Native software packages.

I like to say that my expertise is based on a combination of two things â€“ a **deep understanding of technology** and **experience on how it works in reality**. I understand that resources will always be limited so my goal is always to focus on getting the most return.
